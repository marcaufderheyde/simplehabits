# SimpleHabits
A simple habit tracking application which encourages straightforward tracking of good and bad habits. Take things one step at a time, you're only human!

## What is this?
Hey there, thanks for checking in! After finishing my Computing Science degree at the end of May 2022, I found myself suddenly about to graduate at the end of June 2022.

And honestly, I wasn't ready, not to graduate, and definitely not ready to start a 3-month internship. So, I did the natural thing, and to quote Hector, "built the most typical starter application ever".

Yeah I did, who's gonna stop me?!

## What does this do?
This Android application is a simple habit tracker that works entirely offline with a local SQlite database stored on your phone. You can add Habit categories, which have default currency and sentiment attributes, and you can add habits themselves.

After having setup a few categories (the goal is to limit the amount of habits you are working on), start adding habits. Be consistent and honest, but focus only on a few at a time. No one can fix everything at once, so don't try!

After tracking your habits for about a week, check out the data run down of the habits you have been tracking. You can request the habits from any number of previous days, and these will be displayed as a time graph of bar graph for quick habit analysis.

Tracking a habit should take no longer than ~10 seconds. This involves selecting a category from your pre-defined list of categories, entering the "cost" of the habit, i.e., did you spend or save money whilst carrying out this habit, and selecting the sentiment you feel towards having completed this habit.

## What technologies are used in this application?
As previously mentioned this application uses SQlite for data storage, and Android Studio Java for UI development and data processing.

## Cool I guess I'll try this thing...
Awesome sauce!! Let's get you set-up. I am perma-banned from the Google Play Store (kind of a funny story), so here's a direct download link to the signed APK: [Simple Habits download HERE](https://github.com/marcaufderheyde/simplehabits/raw/master/app/release/app-release.apk).
